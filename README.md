For exercise &amp; assignment submission. 

prerequisites: clone the current repo (see session1 slide)

## On-Class Practical Exercise Workflow


### 1. Get the Latest Updates
Open VS Code

Go to Source Control

Click the Sync button to pull the latest changes


### 2. Never Edit the Starter Files Directly

Under each session folder, you'll find a starter folder containing the exercise materials. 

🙅‍♀️ IMPORTANT: Do NOT edit files directly in the starter folder.

### 3. Create Your Personal Workspace

Copy the entire starter folder

Paste it into the same session folder

Rename it with your name (e.g., marry_jen, john_doe, your_name)

Work on your exercise only inside your personal folder


### 4. Save and Submit Your Work
After completing your exercise or making any changes:

Commit your changes with a descriptive message 

Push/Sync Changes to GitHub


####  Folder Structure Example
Session1/ <br>
├── starter/          ← DO NOT TOUCH! Original materials. Please copy one to your personal workspace! <br>
├── marry_J/        ← Another student's workspace <br>
├── john_D/         ← Another student's workspace <br>
└── your_name/        ← Your workspace <br>


## Assignment Workflow 

### 1. Each group will be assigned a private repository

- Work together as a group in your private repo
- **Commit and push frequently** as you make progress
- All group members should contribute (commits from everyone)
- Use meaningful commit messages (e.g., "added consent form", "fixed timing bug")

### 2. Submit before the deadline

- The **last commit version before the deadline** will be marked
- Ensure all your work is pushed to GitHub
- No extensions - commit history shows when work was done

### 3. Group Contribution

- I will check commit history to verify everyone contributed
- Make sure each member's GitHub account is linked
- Discuss and divide tasks clearly
