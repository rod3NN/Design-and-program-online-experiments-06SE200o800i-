## On-Class Practical Exercise Workflow


### 1. Get the Latest Updates
Open VS Code

Go to Source Control

Click the Sync button to pull the latest changes


### 2. Never Edit the Starter Files Directly

Under each session folder, you'll find a starter folder containing the exercise materials. 

🙅‍♀️ IMPORTANT: Do NOT edit files directly in the master folder.

### 3. Create Your Personal Workspace

Copy the entire starter folder

Paste it into the same session folder

Rename it with your name (e.g., marry_jen, john_doe, your_name)

Work on your exercise only inside your personal folder


### 4. Save and Submit Your Work
After completing your exercise or making any changes:

Commit your changes with a descriptive message 

Push/Sync to GitHub
